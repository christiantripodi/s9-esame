<h1>Netflix in React</h1>
<p>Today your challenge will involve refactoring a Netflix project in JavaScript.
It will need to become a React application with data fetch from "The Open Movie Database".</p>
<p>Recommended steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new react-app, and starting with the provided Netflix project begin to transport the home page interface using React components (navbar, footer, etc.)</li>
<li>Create, using components, several "galleries" for movies (at least 3 galleries with 3 saga movies you like, example: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc.).</li>
<li>These galleries will need to fetch data from Omdb APIs when loading component</li>
<li>[EXTRA] Add loaders and error handling to the main page.</li>
</ul>
